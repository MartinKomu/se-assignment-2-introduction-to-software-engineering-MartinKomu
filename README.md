Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineeringg Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles nad best practises.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Traditional programming is centered around the code while software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. The requirement stage typically includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning.
The design phase involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
The implementation phase is about writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. It also includes system design in an integrated development environment and static code analysis.
The testing phase entails the evaluation of the created software. The testing team evaluates the developed product(s) in order to assess whether they meet the requirements specified in the ‘planning’ phase.
The deployment phase involves the team packaging, managing and deploying releases across different environments and the software is officially released into the production environment.
In the maintenance phase, various elements of the software are monitored. These could include the overall system performance, user experience, new security vulnerabilities, an analysis of bugs or errors in the system

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? In agile methodology, teams use the agile development methodology to minimize risk such as bugs, cost overruns, and changing requirements when adding new functionality. In all agile methods, teams develop the software in iterations that contain mini-increments of the new functionality. The primary benefit of agile software development is that it allows software to be released in iterations which improves efficiency by allowing teams to find and fix defects and align expectation early on.
 The waterfall method is a rigid linear model that consists of sequential phases (requirements, design, implementation, verification, maintenance) focusing on distinct goals. Each phase must be 100% complete before the next phase can start. There’s usually no process for going back to modify the project or direction. Projects with clear objectives and stable requirements can best use the waterfall method. Less experienced project managers and project teams, as well as teams whose composition changes frequently, may benefit the most from using the waterfall development methodology.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Requirements engineering is the process of constructing abstract descriptions of the desired structure or behavior of a system and/or its problem domain. Additionally, the needs or desired structure can be equally linked to the process or to the product. Requirements engineering undergoes five processes namely: 
1.	The feasibility phase involves the study cost and benefit of the project are analyzed. This means under this feasibility study a detailed analysis is carried out will be cost of the project for development which includes all required costs for final development hardware and software resources required, design and development costs operational costs.
2.	The requirements elicitation is related to the various ways used to gain knowledge about the project domain and requirements. The various sources of domain knowledge include customers, business manuals, the existing software of the same type, standards, and other stakeholders of the project. 
3.	The requirements specification is used to produce formal software requirement models. All the requirements including the functional as well as the non-functional requirements and the constraints are specified by these models.
4.	Requirements validation involves different set of tasks that ensures that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements. These requirements should be consistent with all the other requirements i.e. no two requirements should conflict with each other.
5.	Requirement management is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders. 

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? The core concept of modularity involves encapsulating information within a module, exposing only what is necessary through a well-defined interface and hiding the rest. This separation of concerns ensures that individual modules can operate independently while interacting through strictly defined interfaces. 
Modularity improves maintainability in that changes in one module typically do not affect others, making bugs easier to track down and fix without risking other parts of the system.  Modular systems can be scaled more readily by adding new modules or enhancing existing ones without impacting the rest of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? •	Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.
•	System testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
•	Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
•	Unit testing: Validating that each software unit runs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
•	Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.
•	Performance testing: Testing how the software runs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.
•	Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.

Testing is importance because it improvises quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Version control systems is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 
•	GitHub helps software teams to collaborate and maintain the entire history of code changes. You can track changes in code, turn back the clock to undo errors and share your efforts with other team members. It is a repository to host Git projects.
•	Developed by Microsoft, the Team Foundation Server is an enterprise-grade tool to manage source code and other services that need versioning. It can keep track of work items to find defects, requirements, and scenarios in a project. It comes with several unique features like Team Build, data collection and reporting, Team Project Portal, Team Foundation Shared Services.
•	GitLab comes with a lot of handy features like an integrated project, a project website, etc. Using the continuous integration (CI) capabilities of GitLab, you can automatically test and deliver the code. One can access all the aspects of a project, view code, pull requests, and combine the conflict resolution.




Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? A software project manager is the most important person inside a team who takes the overall responsibilities to manage the software projects and plays an important role in the successful completion of the projects. 
Key responsibilities of software project managers are:
•	discussing new projects and proposals with clients, colleagues and other stakeholders
•	planning software projects, determining scope and setting deadlines
•	assembling project teams and allocating roles
•	managing project progress to ensure projects stay on schedule
•	creating project budgets and monitoring project spend
•	overseeing the testing, assessment and evaluation of project quality throughout the project
Some of the challenges faced in managing software projects include:
•	changing the requirements and priorities. The needs of the clients may change as the project progresses. And when that happens, extra time, cost, and resources need to be allocated, which further impacts the project.
•	poor communication with clients, other stakeholders, and the development team affects the overall project.
•	unrealistic deadlines from the clients sometimes, which leads to a race against time might affect the quality of the software.


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. 
The types of maintenance activities are:
•	Corrective software maintenance is the typical, classic form of maintenance when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors.
•	Preventative software maintenance is looking into the future so that your software can keep working as desired for as long as possible. 
•	Perfective software maintenance aims to adjust software by adding new features as necessary and removing features that are irrelevant or not effective in the given software.
•	Adaptive software maintenance has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software.
Maintenance is essential in  the software development cycle as it enhances performance and increased user satisfaction. 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Ethical issues software engineers might face includes unethical data collection. Software developers face a difficult choice regarding personal data. They have two options: develop systems that possibly abuse user data or voice concerns despite going against the project’s objectives.
Algorithm bias another ethical issue that software engineers might face since computers cannot understand morality as a concept. When it is not thoroughly checked, its systems can unintentionally show bias. For instance, when it was discovered that Google’s image processing engine couldn’t adequately reflect black and brown skin tones in images, the company came under fire for allegedly fostering systematic racism. 
Ways software engineers can adhere to ethical standards in their work include:
•	To ensure that the product will be utilized as intended, create policies with the help of other teams inside your organization.
•	As a software engineer, you must assess the current technology you’re developing and take proactive measures to address any potential abuse and other ethical issues in software development.
•	Be honest and avoid falsely advertising features or exaggerating the performance quality which is unethical.
